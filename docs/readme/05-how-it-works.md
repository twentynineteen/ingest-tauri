## How It Works

### AI Script Formatter Workflow

1. **Upload Script**: Select a `.docx` file from your computer (up to 1GB)
2. **Select AI Model**: Choose from available Ollama models running on your machine
3. **AI Processing**: The script is automatically formatted for autocue/teleprompter readability
4. **Review Changes**: View side-by-side diff showing original vs. AI-formatted text
5. **Edit & Refine**: Make manual adjustments to the AI's suggestions if needed
6. **Export**: Download the formatted script as a `.docx` file ready for teleprompter use

### Video Project Workflow

1. **Select Video Files**: Choose footage files from your file system
2. **Assign Cameras**: Organize files by camera number for multi-camera projects
3. **Configure Project**: Set project title and output folder location
4. **Create Project**: Generate organized folder structure with Adobe Premiere integration
5. **Track Progress**: Monitor file operations with real-time progress updates
6. **Integrate & Upload**: Connect with Trello for project management or Sprout Video for hosting
