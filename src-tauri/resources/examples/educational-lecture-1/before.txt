Good morning everyone. In today's lecture, we're going to explore the fascinating world of neural networks and deep learning. These technologies have revolutionized artificial intelligence and are now powering everything from voice assistants to autonomous vehicles. A neural network is essentially a computational model inspired by the way biological neural networks in the human brain process information. It consists of interconnected nodes, or neurons, organized in layers. Each connection between neurons has a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The learning process involves feeding the network training data and adjusting these weights to minimize the difference between the network's predictions and the actual outcomes. This process is called backpropagation. Deep learning refers to neural networks with multiple hidden layers, allowing them to learn increasingly complex patterns and representations. The deeper the network, the more abstract the features it can learn.
