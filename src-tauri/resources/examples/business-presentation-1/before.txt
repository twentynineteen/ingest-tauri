Welcome to our Q4 business review. Today we'll be covering several important topics including our financial performance, market expansion initiatives, and strategic priorities for the coming year. Let me start by saying that this has been an exceptional quarter for our organization. We've seen significant growth across all major business units and our team has demonstrated remarkable dedication and innovation. Our revenue for the quarter came in at $45.2 million, which represents a 23% increase year-over-year. This growth was driven primarily by our enterprise sales division, which closed several major contracts with Fortune 500 companies. Additionally, our customer retention rate improved to 94%, which is a testament to the quality of our product and the dedication of our customer success team. Looking ahead to next quarter, we have ambitious plans to expand into three new geographic markets and launch our next-generation platform. Thank you all for your hard work and commitment to excellence.
