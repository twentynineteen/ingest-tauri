# BuildProject Fix Summary

## Problem
After refactoring BuildProject to use XState state machine and custom hooks, the success card stopped appearing after project creation. The state machine wasn't transitioning properly from `copyingFiles` → `creatingTemplate` → `showingSuccess`.

## Root Cause
The XState state machine was not properly handling the `COPY_COMPLETE` event, causing the state transitions to fail. The event listener setup in `useBuildProjectMachine` was receiving the events, but the state machine wasn't transitioning correctly.

## Solution Implemented
Instead of trying to fix the complex state machine transitions, we implemented a simpler workaround that mimics the original working implementation:

### 1. Direct Event Listener in BuildProject Component
Added a direct listener for the `copy_complete` event in BuildProject.tsx that sets a local `projectCompleted` state:

```typescript
// Track project completion locally (simpler approach like old implementation)
const [projectCompleted, setProjectCompleted] = useState(false)

// Listen for copy_complete event directly (like old useCopyProgress hook)
useEffect(() => {
  let unlisten: (() => void) | null = null
  const setupListener = async () => {
    const { listen } = await import('@tauri-apps/api/event')
    unlisten = await listen('copy_complete', (event) => {
      setProjectCompleted(true)
    })
  }
  setupListener()
  return () => {
    if (unlisten) unlisten()
  }
}, [])
```

### 2. Use Local State for Success Display
Instead of relying on the broken state machine's `isShowingSuccess`, use the local `projectCompleted` state:

```typescript
// Use projectCompleted for showing success section (like old implementation)
const showSuccess = projectCompleted

// Pass to SuccessSection
<SuccessSection
  showSuccess={showSuccess}
  selectedFolder={projectFolder || selectedFolder}
  // ...other props
/>
```

### 3. Additional Fallback
Added a fallback that triggers when the state machine enters `creatingTemplate` state:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (isCreatingTemplate && !projectCompleted) {
    setProjectCompleted(true)
  }
}, [isCreatingTemplate, projectCompleted])
```

### 4. Fixed isLoading Derivation
Removed `creatingTemplate` from the loading states so the success card can display during template creation:

```typescript
isLoading:
  state.matches('validating') ||
  state.matches('creatingFolders') ||
  state.matches('savingBreadcrumbs') ||
  state.matches('copyingFiles'),
  // Don't include creatingTemplate - success should show during this
```

### 5. Fixed Reset Logic
Ensure the state properly resets when starting a new project:

```typescript
const clearFields = () => {
  clearAllFields()
  send({ type: 'RESET' })
  setProjectCompleted(false)  // Reset local state
}
```

### 6. Fixed Ref Reset in usePostProjectCompletion
Reset refs when machine returns to idle state:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (isIdle) {
    templateCreated.current = false
    dialogShown.current = false
  }
}, [isIdle])
```

## Cleanup
- Removed all console.log statements to fix linting errors
- Removed unused variables (`loading` parameter in SuccessSection)
- Removed debug logging from state machine

## Files Modified
1. `/src/pages/BuildProject/BuildProject.tsx` - Added direct event listener and local state
2. `/src/pages/BuildProject/SuccessSection.tsx` - Removed console.logs and fixed unused variable
3. `/src/hooks/useBuildProjectMachine.ts` - Removed debug logging, fixed isLoading
4. `/src/hooks/usePostProjectCompletion.ts` - Fixed ref reset logic
5. `/src/pages/BuildProject/ProgressBar.tsx` - Removed unused logger import

## Result
- Success card now appears immediately after file copy completes
- "Start New Project" button properly resets all state
- No constant screen refreshes or performance issues
- All tests passing
- No linting errors in modified files

## Future Consideration
The XState state machine implementation should be reviewed and potentially simplified. The current workaround bypasses the state machine for success display, which works but isn't ideal architecturally. A proper fix would involve debugging why the state machine transitions aren't working as expected.
