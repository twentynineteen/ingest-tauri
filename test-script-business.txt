Welcome to our quarterly business update. Today I'll be presenting our financial results for Q4. We've seen tremendous growth across all business segments and I'm excited to share these results with you. Our revenue this quarter reached $48 million which represents significant year over year growth. This was driven by strong performance in our enterprise division and excellent customer retention rates. Our team has worked tirelessly to achieve these outstanding results and I want to thank everyone for their dedication. Looking forward to next quarter, we have exciting plans for market expansion and new product launches.
